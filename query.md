### Question 2: What's the most common departure airport in Asia?

**Answer**: To determine the most common departure airport in Asia for 2025-07-21, I need to analyze the departure_airport and departure_timezone data, filtering for locations within the Asia timezone. I will then count the occurrences of each airport to identify the most frequent one.

```tool_code
import pandas as pd

data = [{'id': 67, 'flight_date': '2025-07-21', 'flight_status': 'scheduled', 'departure_airport': 'Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport', 'departure_timezone': 'Australia/Sydney', 'arrival_airport': 'Brisbane International', 'arrival_timezone': 'Australia/Brisbane', 'airline_name': 'Jetstar'}, {'id': 5, 'flight_date': '2025-07-21', 'flight_status': 'scheduled', 'departure_airport': 'Irkutsk', 'departure_timezone': 'Asia/Irkutsk', 'arrival_airport': 'Chita', 'arrival_timezone': 'Asia/Yakutsk', 'airline_name': 'S7 Airlines'}, {'id': 82, 'flight_date': '2025-07-21', 'flight_status': 'scheduled', 'departure_airport': 'Guam International', 'departure_timezone': 'Pacific/Guam', 'arrival_airport': 'Ninoy Aquino International', 'arrival_timezone': 'Asia/Manila', 'airline_name': 'Philippine Airlines'}]
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

asia_flights = df[df['departure_timezone'].str.contains('Asia')]

if not asia_flights.empty:
    most_common_airport = asia_flights['departure_airport'].value_counts().idxmax()
    print(most_common_airport)
else:
    print("No flights departing from Asia found in the dataset.")

```

### Question 3: How many flights are operated by Air New Zealand?

**Answer**: Based on the current dataset of 100 flights scheduled for 2025-07-21, I need to examine the 'airline_name' column to determine how many flights are operated by Air New Zealand. I do not have that information readily available and need to query the dataset for it.
